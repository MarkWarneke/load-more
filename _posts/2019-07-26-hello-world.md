This is my very first blog post to introduce you to my new site.
I am going to publish content around a variety of topics from general IT-Consulting, Cloud Consulting (especially around Azure), as well as Web and Software Engineering topics. You can expect posts on automation and DevOps - focusing on PowerShell, Infrastructure as Code and Azure DevOps.

**Note:** Opinions are my own

I currently work for Microsoft, however, all content published on this domain is based on my experience and opinions. My recommendations might not align with official statements from Microsoft and must not be quoted as such.
